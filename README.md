# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis Using Excel

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to uncover the key reasons behind booking cancellations. By importing and cleaning the dataset in Excel, various factors contributing to cancellations were identified and visualized through charts and pivot tables.

## 🎯 Objective
The main goal of this project is to:
- Identify patterns and reasons behind hotel booking cancellations.
- Analyze trends related to customer behavior, room type, lead time, and booking channels.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce future cancellation rates.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about hotel bookings, including:
- Booking details (dates, room types, stays)
- Customer information
- Deposit types
